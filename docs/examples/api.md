# Gallery properties

See the Typescript def file (index.d.ts) for more detailed information until I update this. 

Property        |       Type            |       Default         |       Description
:-----------------------|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------------------------
photos | array  | undefined  | An array of Photos objects.  See below.
columns | number or function  | undefined  | Optional. The number of columns in a column layout (direction=column). Will use Gallery's breakpoint choosing if undefined.
targetRowHeight | number or (containerWidth) => number  | undefined  | Optional.  The algorithm will do its best to have rows close to this value. The smaller the number, the more photos will be in a row.
maxPhotosPerRow | number or (containerWidth) => number  | undefined  | Optional.  The algorithm decides this for you by default and changes on breakpoints. The purpose is to limit how many neighboring nodes to search for when visiting each note to find the best path or photo to break on.  The smaller the number, the faster your gallery will calculate.  Do not use large numbers as speed will slow down exponentially. Do not change unless you understand its usage.
onClick | function  | undefined  | Optional. Do something when the user clicks a photo.  Receives arguments event and an object containing the index, Photos obj originally sent and the next and previous photos in the gallery if they exist
margin | number  | 2  | optional; number of margin pixels around each entire image
direction | string | 'row' | optional; `column` or `row` based layout
renderImage | function | default component | optional; use a different image component than the default provided to display your photo
